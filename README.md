# fccd-orchestrator
VM orchestrator for Firecracker-Containerd

# Golang specifics
Need to clone the firecracker-containerd dependency (that might be a fork) under 
`src/github/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd` because this repo depends on
repos from the origin. This Golang/fork workaround is taken from [here](http://code.openark.org/blog/development/forking-golang-repositories-on-github-and-managing-the-import-path).

# Networking
The orchestrator (re)uses the taps (IPs) when starting and stopping VMs.

Note: CNI network configuration is supported in general (commented out for now) but it does not allow to 
keep track of the IP addresses that are given to VMs or reuse them.
