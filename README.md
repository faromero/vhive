## Mission

vHive aims to enable serverless systems researchers to innovate across the deep and distributed software stacks
of a modern serverless platform. Hence, we built vHive to be representative of the leading
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) providers, integrating the same production-grade components used by the providers, including
[AWS Firecracker hypervisor](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/),
Cloud Native Computing Foundation's [Containerd](https://containerd.io/),
and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

vHive adopts the [Knative](https://knative.dev/) flexible programming model, allowing the researchers to quickly deploy
and experiment with *any* serverless applications that may comprise many functions,
running in secure Firecracker microVMs, as well as serverfull services.
Both the functions and the stateful services can be deployed using OCI/Docker images.

vHive empowers systems researchers to innovate on key serverless features,
including functions autoscaling and cold-start delay optimization with several snapshotting mechanisms.


## vHive architecture

![vHive Architecture](docs/figures/vhive_architecture.jpg)

The details of the vHive architecture can be found in our ASPLOS'21 paper
([extended abstract](https://asplos-conference.org/abstracts/asplos21-paper212-extended_abstract.pdf),
[full paper](docs/papers/REAP_ASPLOS21.pdf)).

## Getting started with vHive

vHive can be readily deployed on premises or in cloud, with support for nested virtualization.
We provide [a quick-start guide](docs/quickstart_guide.md)
that describes how to set up an experiment with vHive.


## Developing vHive

### Developer's guide and performance analysis with vHive

We provide a basic developer's guide that we plan to extend in future.
We encourage the community to contribute their analysis scenarios and tools.

### vHive roadmap

vHive is a community-led project, maintained by the EASE lab.
The current roadmap is [available](https://github.com/ease-lab/vhive/projects/1)
and is going to be updated to accommodate the community's goals and evolution.
To guarantee high code quality and reliability, we deploy fully automated CI
on cloud and self-hosted runners with GitHub Actions.

The statistics of this repository's views, clones, forks is available by the following
[link](https://ease-lab.github.io/vhive.github.io/ease-lab/vhive/latest-report/report.html).


### Getting help and contributing

We would be happy to answer any questions in GitHub Issues and encourage the open-source community
to submit new Issues, assist in addressing existing issues and limitations, and contribute their code with Pull Requests.
You can also talk to us on the official [Firecracker Slack](https://firecracker-microvm.slack.com) in the **#firecracker-vHive-research** channel.
