## Scripts for automated deployment and benchmarking for vHive

* `deployer/client.go` deploys functions of types and quantity as defined in `deployer/functions.json`.
* `invoker/client.go` invokes functions and reports the latencies and throughput (RPS).

We encourage the community to experiment with these basic tools, build and contribute more sophisticated tools for performance analysis with vHive.
