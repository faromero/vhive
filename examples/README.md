# Deployment and benchmarking tools

* `deployer/client.go` deploys functions of types and quantity as defined in `deployer/functions.json`.
* `invoker/client.go` invokes functions and reports the latencies and throughput (RPS).

More details on using this tools are available in the [quickstart guide](../docs/quickstart_guide.md).

We encourage the community to experiment with these basic tools,
extend them and contribute new tools for performance analysis
of various scenarios.
